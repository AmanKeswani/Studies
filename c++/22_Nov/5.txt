In C++, scope resolution operator is (::). It is used for following purposes. 
1) To access a global variable when there is a local variable with same name: 
2) To define a function outside a class. 
3) To access a classâ€™s static variables. 
4) In case of multiple Inheritance: If same variable name exists in two ancestor classes, we can use scope resolution operator to distinguish.
5) For namespace If a class having the same name exists inside two namespace we can use the namespace name with the scope resolution operator to refer that class without any conflicts
6) Refer to a class inside another class: If a class exists inside another class we can use the nesting class to refer the nested class using the scope resolution operator
