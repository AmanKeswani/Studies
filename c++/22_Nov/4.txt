Constructor in C++ is a special method that is invoked automatically at the time of object creation. It is used to initialize the data members of new objects generally. The constructor in C++ has the same name as the class or structure. Constructor is invoked at the time of object creation. It constructs the values i.e. provides data for the object which is why it is known as constructors.
Constructor does not have a return value, hence they do not have a return type.
The prototype of Constructors is as follows:
    <class-name> (list-of-parameters);

The syntax for defining the constructor within the class:
    <class-name> (list-of-parameters) { // constructor definition }
The syntax for defining the constructor outside the class:
    <class-name>: :<class-name> (list-of-parameters){ // constructor definition }

Initializing objects with non parametrized constructors is the same way you define a object without a constructor.
Initializing objects with parametrized constructors includes passing the values for the parameters required by the constructor. Example:

    <class-name> <object-name>( --{parameters}-- );
